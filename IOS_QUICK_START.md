## 🎯 Next Steps (Your Action Items)

### Immediate (Before First Build)

1. **Create Apple Developer Account**
   - URL: https://developer.apple.com/programs/
   - Cost: $99/year
   - Approval time: 24-48 hours

2. **Sign Up for CodeMagic**
   - URL: https://codemagic.io/
   - Use GitHub login
   - Free tier available

3. **Push Code to GitHub**
   - Ensure this project is in a GitHub repository
   - Make sure `ios` folder is committed

### Setup (First Time Only)

4. **Configure Apple Developer Portal**
   - Create App ID: `com.mattyc.heartlift`
   - Create App Store Connect listing

5. **Connect CodeMagic**
   - Add your GitHub repository
   - Connect Apple Developer account
   - Set up automatic code signing

6. **Update Configuration**
   - Edit `codemagic.yaml`:
     - Add your email address
     - Add your Apple ID
   - Commit and push changes

### Build & Test

7. **Trigger First Build**
   - In CodeMagic: "Start new build"
   - Select `ios-workflow`
   - Wait 15-20 minutes

8. **Test with TestFlight**
   - Download .ipa from CodeMagic artifacts
   - Upload to TestFlight (automatic if configured)
   - Install on iOS device and test

### Pre-Launch

9. **Replace Placeholder Icons** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Current icons are temporary pink/purple gradients
   - Design professional 1024x1024 icon
   - Generate all sizes and replace in:
     `frontend/ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`
   - Re-run `python3 frontend/generate_icons.py` with your design

10. **Prepare App Store Assets**
    - Take screenshots on required device sizes
    - Write compelling app description
    - Add keywords for ASO
    - Prepare marketing materials

### Launch

11. **Submit to App Store**
    - Complete App Store Connect listing
    - Submit for review
    - Respond to any Apple feedback
    - Release when approved! 🎉

## 📊 Key Files & Locations

| File/Folder | Purpose | Edit? |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `frontend/capacitor.config.ts` | Capacitor settings | Only if changing Bundle ID |
| `frontend/ios/` | Native iOS project | Usually auto-generated |
| `frontend/dist/` | Built web assets | Auto-generated by build |
| `codemagic.yaml` | CI/CD configuration | Yes - add your details |
| `frontend/.env` | Environment variables | Check REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL |
| `IOS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | Full instructions | Read for details |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Icons**: Current icons are PLACEHOLDERS. Must replace before App Store submission.

2. **Backend**: App is configured to use:
   - Backend API: https://aichat-heartlift.preview.emergentagent.com
   - Supabase: hmmimemzznsyilxqakty.supabase.co

3. **Testing**: Always test with TestFlight before public release

4. **Code Signing**: Let CodeMagic handle automatic code signing

5. **Build Location**: Web app builds to `dist/` (not `build/`)

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

**Build fails in CodeMagic:**
- Check that `ios` folder is in Git
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check CodeMagic build logs for specific error

**App crashes on device:**
- Verify backend URL is accessible
- Check Supabase credentials
- Look at device console logs in Xcode

**Can't connect to backend:**
- Ensure REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL is correct in `.env`
- Check that backend server is running
- Verify CORS settings on backend
