### **YouTube Shorts Strategy:**

#### **Content Approach:**

YouTube Shorts works similarly to TikTok but with slightly different audience:
- Slightly older demographic (25-35 vs TikTok's 18-24)
- More educational/self-improvement focused
- Better for longer-form explanations (up to 60 seconds)

#### **Video Types:**

1. **Quick Psychology Lessons** (30-60 seconds)
   - Attachment theory basics
   - Communication patterns
   - Red flags in relationships

2. **App Features & Demos** (30-45 seconds)
   - How to use HeartLift
   - AI coach responses to common questions
   - Success stories

3. **Advice Format** (45-60 seconds)
   - "What to do when..."
   - "How to tell if..."
   - "Signs that..."

#### **YouTube Shorts Best Practices:**

- **Vertical Format**: 9:16 aspect ratio (1080x1920)
- **Length**: 15-60 seconds
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive, keyword-rich (max 100 chars)
- **Description**: Include keywords + app link
- **#Shorts** in title or description (required for algorithm)
- **Thumbnail**: YouTube auto-generates, but first frame matters
- **Post Frequency**: 3-5 per week

#### **Sample First 5 Shorts:**

**Short 1:**
