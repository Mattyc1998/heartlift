I'm sorry you're having trouble with your subscription. Let's get this sorted out quickly!

For subscription issues, Apple handles all billing through the App Store. Here's what you can do:

2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap Subscriptions
4. Look for HeartLift

**To restore purchases:**

2. Go to Settings/Profile
3. Tap "Restore Purchases"

**For refunds:**
Apple manages all refunds. You can request one here:
https://reportaproblem.apple.com

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please let me know:

I'm sorry to see you go, but I understand. I'll process your account deletion request right away.

If you'd like to share why you're leaving, your feedback would help us improve (totally optional).

To confirm deletion, please reply "YES, DELETE MY ACCOUNT" and I'll process it within 24 hours.

## 🛡️ **BOUNDARIES & SELF-CARE**

As a founder supporting users dealing with heartbreak and emotional issues:

**Set Boundaries:**
- ✅ Respond during business hours (e.g., 9am-6pm)
- ✅ Use templates to save mental energy
- ✅ Don't feel obligated to respond instantly
- ✅ It's okay to take breaks

**Protect Your Mental Health:**
- ⚠️ Emotional stories can be draining
- ⚠️ Don't take on users' problems personally
- ⚠️ Set "no support" time blocks
- ⚠️ Consider hiring support help after 100+ daily users

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- User becomes aggressive/abusive
- User messages excessively (5+ times/day)
- User shares inappropriate content
- User treats you as their personal therapist

**How to Handle:**
```
"I understand you're going through a difficult time. However, HeartLift support is for app-related questions only. For ongoing emotional support, please reach out to a licensed therapist or crisis helpline. We're unable to provide personal counseling through support channels."
```

## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

1. **Use Users' Names**: Personal touch matters ("Hi Sarah" vs "Hi")
2. **Be Human**: "I'm sorry this happened" vs "We apologize for the inconvenience"
3. **Under-Promise, Over-Deliver**: Say 48 hours, respond in 12
4. **Turn Support into Marketing**: Happy users leave reviews
5. **Ask for Feedback**: "How did we do?" after resolving
6. **Keep Templates Fresh**: Don't sound robotic
7. **Log Feature Requests**: Build what users actually want
8. **Respond to Reviews**: Shows you care, helps App Store ranking
9. **Set Expectations Early**: Auto-reply with response time
10. **Take Breaks**: Support can be emotionally taxing
